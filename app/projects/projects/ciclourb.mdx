The **Ciclourb** project is a web platform focused on the **urban cycling network observatory**, allowing users to visualize, analyze, and monitor cycling infrastructure data. The system was built with an emphasis on **usability, performance, and geospatial data integration**, using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**.

## Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Visualization of the urban cycling network with customizable layers and support for multiple geospatial datasets.
- **Indicators and Metrics**: Dashboard for analyzing density, length, type, and quality of cycling infrastructure.
- **Advanced Filters**: Segment data by region, road type, surface, and network connectivity.
- **Data Export**: Export maps and reports in CSV, PDF, and GeoJSON formats.
- **Integration with Public Data**: Consumes open data and public APIs to keep the observatory up-to-date.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for responsive interfaces and interactive dashboards.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express to serve data, process metrics, and manage API endpoints.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS to store geospatial data and support complex spatial queries.
- **Map Engine**: Integrated with MapLibre GL for vector and raster map rendering.
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with CI/CD pipelines for seamless cloud deployment.
