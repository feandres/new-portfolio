summary: "A full-stack web application that allows users to generate and manage dynamic QR codes with customizable redirection URLs and usage tracking."
---

This project is a **Dynamic QR Code Generator**, a web platform designed to create, manage, and monitor QR codes that redirect to customizable URLs. The solution was built with a strong focus on usability, performance, and scalability using **React**, **Node.js**, and **Express**.

## Features

- **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: Users can generate QR codes linked to modifiable URLs without changing the QR itself.
- **Link Management**: Full control over destination URLs, expiration dates, and access rules.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View usage statistics including scan counts, locations, and timestamps.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with token-based sessions to manage personal QR code libraries.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, responsive UI across devices.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express, with routes for QR generation, URL redirection, and analytics logging.
- **Database**: MongoDB used for storing user data, QR metadata, and access logs.
- **QR Code Engine**: Integrated `qrcode` and `shortid` libraries to generate and manage unique codes and short URLs.
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker and deployed using Railway for seamless CI/CD.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was designing an efficient and secure redirection mechanism that logs access data without impacting latency. I implemented middleware to asynchronously log scan events, ensuring redirection remained fast. I also enforced best practices in API design, securing routes with JWT authentication and sanitizing inputs to prevent injection attacks.

This project strengthened my **full-stack engineering skills**, particularly in designing secure REST APIs, managing stateful frontends, and optimizing for performance and scalability.

## Future Improvements

- Role-based access for teams managing multiple QR campaigns.
- Support for A/B testing of redirection URLs.
- Exportable analytics reports in CSV/PDF format.
- Integration with external marketing tools via webhook.
