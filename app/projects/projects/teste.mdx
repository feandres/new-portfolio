This project is a **Personal Finance Tracker**, a web application designed to help users manage their personal finances effectively. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it provides a clean and intuitive interface for tracking expenses, setting budgets, and visualizing financial data.

## Features

- **Budget Planning**: Set monthly budgets for different categories and receive alerts when approaching limits.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize spending patterns and financial health.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and MongoDB for storing user data securely.
- **APIs**: Integration with third-party APIs for real-time currency conversion and financial tips.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel for easy scalability and continuous deployment.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was optimizing the performance of the data visualization components to handle large datasets efficiently. By implementing lazy loading and memoization, I improved the application's responsiveness. Additionally, ensuring data security for sensitive financial information required careful implementation of encryption and secure API practices.

This project enhanced my skills in **full-stack development**, particularly in integrating frontend and backend technologies seamlessly, and deepened my understanding of **user experience design** for financial applications.

## Future Improvements

- Adding multi-currency support for international users.
- Implementing machine learning to provide personalized financial insights.
- Enhancing accessibility features to ensure inclusivity for all users.
